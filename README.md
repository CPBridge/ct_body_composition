# CT Body Composition

*NOTE*: As of May 2024, this project is now archived in favor of
[this](https://github.com/Rosenthal-Lab-at-Dana-Farber/ct_body_composition) updated version that now includes
model weights.

This repository provides code for training and running body composition estimation models on abdominal CT scans.

### Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you have two options for setting up the environment.
You may install all the necessary components directly on your system, or if you have docker on your machine,
you may build a docker image that contains all the necessary requirements.

See the documentation pages for further details:
* [Installation](docs/installation.md) - For installing directly on your system
* [Docker](docs/docker.md) - For building and using the docker image
* [Training](docs/training.md) - For training new models
* [Inference](docs/inference.md) - For running the model on new data

### Model Weights

At this stage, we are not releasing our trained model weights publicly on github, and you will not find them in this
repository. You are welcome to use this code on your own data to develop your own model, and you will find full
instructions on how to do so in the documentation. We are however happy to discuss collaboration possibilities with
investigators interested in using our models (including the deep learning models and population curve
models) for their own studies. Please email us to discuss further:

- Kirti Magudia, Duke University (kirti dot magudia at duke dot edu)
- Michael Rosenthal, Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Michael underscore Rosenthal at dfci dot harvard dot edu)
- Florian Fintelmann, Massachusetts General Hospital (fintelmann at mgh dot harvard dot edu)
- Camden Bay, Brigham and Women's Hospital (cpbay at bwh dot harvard dot edu)
